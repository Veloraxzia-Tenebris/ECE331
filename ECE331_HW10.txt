Output:
	The average height of a BST with 4 elements is 3.46, which is about 3.33...
	The average height of a BST with 16 elements is 10.02.

Comments:
	This is the exact actual output of my code.
	There are a few commented out bits that show more in-depth testing.
	There's also functions to print the arrays, BST in-line, and even one that makes a 2D diagram.
